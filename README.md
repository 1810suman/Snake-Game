# Snake-Game
The Snake game code utilizes Python's Tkinter library to create a classic game. The SnakeGame class manages the game's state, including the snake's movement, food generation, and collision detection. Arrow keys control the snake's direction, with the player aiming to eat red food dots to grow. The game pauses and resumes with a toggle button. A restart_game function resets the snake and score upon game over. The update function continuously updates the game state, drawing the snake and food on the canvas. Overall, the code provides a fully functional Snake game interface.
